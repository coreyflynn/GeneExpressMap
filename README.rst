GeneExpress3D
=============

GeneExpress3D makes possible the rapid, three -dimensional analysis of multiplex fluorescent whole mount in situ hybridizartion (F-WMISH) data at single cell resolution. It relies on the assignment of F-WMISH signal to individual cells based on the proximity of cytoplasmic hybridization signal to cell nuclei. GeneExpress3D greatly extends the power of multiplex F-WMISH for analyzing patterns of gene expression and is a powerful tool for gene regulatory network analysis.

Features include:

- Intuitive user interface
- Construction of a true three dimensional model of F-WMISH hybridization data
- Export of processed image data facilitates visualization through third party software

Requirements
============

GeneExpress3D is provided "as is" and technical support will be provided only as time allows.  Please email flynn.corey@gmail.com for any support requests.
